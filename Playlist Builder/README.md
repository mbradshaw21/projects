# Playlist Maker
#### Matthew Bradshaw, 2019

## Overview
This program stems from my passion for music and wanting to add some variety to my listening habits.
It takes in an entire music library file generated by iTunes, parses it, and allows users to set specifications in order to create the perfect, slightly random playlist.


## Functionality
#### Methods
* `parseXML(xmlLibrary)`
    * Parses the iTunes library file and creates a text file of everything in the library

* `getSongs()`
    * Creates a dictionary from the music library and creates a list of every bit of information about the song after decoding it
    * The lists created are then used to create a dict with the key being the song name and the value being the corresponding artist name

* `printLibrary()`
    * Simply prints your entire music library in alphabetical order

* `makePlaylist(numSongs)`
    * Takes in the amount of songs the user would like in the playlist, and creates a completely random playlist from your library
    * THe playlist is outputted as a dict with each key being a song and each value being the corresponding artist
    
* `makeSpecificPlaylist(numSongs)`
    * Makes a playlist based on user preferences specified with specificArtist(artistName), specificSong(targetSong, numSongs), or both

* `printPlaylist()`
    * Outputs the playlist generated by the program
    
* `specificArtist(artistName)`
    * Finds the artist that the user has chosen to include in the playlist
    * Creates a list of songs for the makeSpecificPlaylist function to choose from in order to create a random playlist of songs from this artist
    
* `specificSong(targetSong, numSongs)`
    * Finds the songs that the user has chosen to include in the playlist
    * Creates a list of songs for the makeSpecificPlaylist function to indefinitely include during the generation of the user's playlist
